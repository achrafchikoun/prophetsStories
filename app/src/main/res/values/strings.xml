    <string name="p0"><b>Informing the Angels About Adam</b>\n\n
Allah the Almighty revealed:\n\n
<i>
\u0022Remember when your Lord said to the angels: \u0022Verily, I am going to place
mankind generations after generations on earth.\u0022 They said: \u0022Will You place
therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify
You with praises and thanks (exalted be You above all that they associate with
You as partners) and sanctify You.\u0022 Allah said: \u0022I know that which you do not
know.\u0027 \n\n
Allah taught Adam all the names of everything, then He showed them to the
angels and said: \u0022Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.\u0022 They (angels)
said: \u0022 Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us.
Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise.\u0022 \n\n
He said: \u0022 O Adam! Inform them of their names,\u0022 and when he had informed
them of their names, He said: \u0022 Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the
heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been
hiding?\u0022\n\n
Remember when We said to the angels: \u0022Prostrate yourself before Adam\u0022 They
prostrated except Iblis, he refused and was proud and was one of the
disbelievers(disobedient to Allah).\u0022\n\n
We said: \u0022O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and both of you
freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will but come
not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimeen (wrongdoers).\u0022
Then the Satan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from
that in which they were. We said: \u0022Get you down all with enmity between
yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a
time.\u0022\n\n
    Then Adam received from his Lord Words. His Lord pardoned him (accepted his
repentance). Verily He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the most
Merciful.\n\n
We said: \u0022Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever
there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance there
shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve. But those who disbelieve and
belie Our Ayah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, and signs and revelations,
etc) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.\u0022 </i>(Chapter
2:30-39, Qur\u0027an).\n\n
<b>Almighty Allah also revealed:</b>
<i>
    \u0022And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the
noble shape of a human being), then We told the angels, \u0022Prostrate to Adam\u0022,
and they prostrated, except Iblis, he refused to be those who prostrate.
Allah said: \u0022What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not postrate when I
commanded you?\u0022\n\n
Iblis said: \u0022I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire and him You
created from clay.\u0022\n\n
Allah said: \u0022O Iblis get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be
arrogant here. Get out for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.\u0022
Iblis said: \u0022Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (Day of
Resurrection).\u0022\n\n
Allah said: \u0022You are of those allowed respite.\u0022\n\n
Iblis said: \u0022Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against
them (human beings) on Your Straight Path. Then I will come to them from
before them and behind them, from their right and from their left and You will
not find most of them as thankful ones (they will not be dutiful to You).\u0022\n\n
Allah said: \u0022Get out from Paradise, disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them
(mankind) will follow you, then surely I will fill Hell with you all.\u0022\n\n
\u0022And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both
wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the Zalimeen
(unjust and wrongdoers).\u0022\n\n
â€œThen Satan whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which
was hidden from them of their private parts before, he said:\u0022 Your Lord did not
forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals.\u0022\n\n
Satan swore by Allah to them both saying: \u0022Verily I am one of the sincere well
wishers for you both.\u0022\n\n
So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which
was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them
and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order
to cover their shame). Their Lord called out to them saying \u0022Did I not forbid you
that tree and tell you, Verily Satan is an open enemy unto you?\u0022\n\n
They said: \u0022Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and
bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.\u0022 Allah said:
\u0022Get down one of you an enemy to the other (i.e. Adam, Eve, and Satan etc). On
earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment, for a time.\u0022 He said:
\u0022therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be
brought out (resurrected).\u0022 </i>(Chapter 7:11-25 Qur\u0027an).\n\n
We imagine when Allah the Almighty decided to create Adam: He addressed His angels and told
them to prostrate before him. He did not mean to ask their opinion or take their advice, for He is
above that. Allah the Exalted told them that He was going to create a vicegerent on the earth who
would have children and grandchildren who would corrupt the earth and shed each other\u0027s blood.
That is why the angels said to Allah the Almighty: <i>\u0022Will You place therein those who will make
mischief therein and shed blood!\u0022</i> (Chapter 2:30 Quran).\n\n
There are old traditions about the angels before the creation of Adam. According to Ibn Qatadah,
it was said that the angels were informed about the creation of Adam and his progency by the jinn
who lived before Adam. Abdullah Ibn Umar said that the jinn had existed for about 2000 years
before Adam and then shed blood. Therefore Allah sent on them an army of angels that drove
them out to the depths of the seas.\n\n
Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Ali jafar Al Baqer that the angels were informed that man would
cause wickedness and shed blood on earth. It was also said that they knew that no one would be
created on earth who would not be wicked and shed blood.\n\n
Whether or not these traditions are correct, the angels did understand that Allah would create a
vicegerent on earth. Allah the Almighty announced that HE was going to create a human being
out of clay, that HE would mold him and blow His spirit into him and then the angels should
prostrate before him.\n\n
Abi Musa al Sha\u0027arai narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \u0022Allah
created Adam from a handful of dust taken from different lands, so the children of Adam have
been created according to the composition of the land. Therefore from mankind we have white,
red, black and yellow ones; we have good and evil, ease and sorrow, and what comes in between
them.\u0022 (Sahih al Bukhari).\n\n
        Ibn Masud and other companions of the Prophet (PBUH) said that Allah the Almighty sent
Gabriel onto the earth to said that Allah the Almighty sent Gabriel onto the earth to get Him clay
therefrom. The earth said: \u0022I seek refuge in Allah from your decreasing my quantity or disfiguring
me.\u0022 So Gabriel returned and did not take anything. He said: \u0022My Lord, the land sought refuge in
You and it granted.\u0022\n\n
So Allah sent Michael for the same purpose, and the land sought refuge with Allah and it was
granted. So he went back and said to Allah what Gabriel has said before him. Then Allah sent the
Angel of Death, and the land sought refuge in Allah, the angel said: \u0022I also seek refuge with Allah
from returning without carrying out His command.\u0022 So he took clay from the face of the earth
and mixed it. He did not take from one particular place, but rather he took white, red, and black
clay from different places.\n\n
The Angel of Death ascended with it, Allah soaked the clay till it became sticky. Then Allah said
to the angels:\n\n
        <i>\u0022Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him
(his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.\u0022</i> (Chapter 38:71-72 Quran).
So Allah shaped Adam into a human being, but he remained a figure of clay for fourty years. The
angels went past him. They were seized with fear by what they saw, and Iblis felt fear most. He
used to pass by the figure of Adam, buffeting it, which would make a sound like pottery. Allah
told us:\n
<i>\u0022He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.\u0022</i> (Chapter 55:Quran).
When the time drew near to breathe the spirit into Adam, as Allah decreed, He commanded the
angels: \u0022When I breathe My spirit into him prostrate before him.\u0022 Allah breathed His spirit into
Adam and when it reached his head Adam sneezed. The angels said: \u0022Say all praise belongs to
Allah.\u0022 Adam repeated: \u0022All praise belongs to Allah.\u0022 Allah said to him: \u0022Your Lord has granted
you mercy.\u0022 When the spirit reached his eyes, Adam looked at the fruits of Paradise. When it
reached his abdomen Adam felt an appetite for food. He jumped hurriedly before the spirit could
reach his legs, so that he could eat from the fruits of Paradise. Allah, therefore, said:\n\n
        <i>\u0022Man is created of haste.\u0022</i> (Chapter 21:37 Quran).\n\n
And then:\n\n
<i>\u0022The angels prostrated themselves all of them together. Except Iblis, he refused to be among the
prostrators.</i> (Ch 15:31-32 Quran).\n
Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \u0022Allah created Adam from dust
after He mixed the clay and left him for some time until it became sticky mud, after which Allah
shaped him. After that Allah left him till it became like potter\u0027s clay. Iblis used to go past him
saying \u0027You have been created for a great purpose.\u0027 After that Allah breathed His spirit into him.
The first thing into which the spirit passed was his eye and then his nose. He sneezed. Allah said:
\u0022May your Lord have mercy upon you, O Adam! Go to those angels and see what they would
say.\u0027 So Adam went and greeted them. they replied saying: \u0022Peace be upon you and the mercy and
blessings of Allah.\u0022 Allah said: \u0022O Adam! This is your greeting and that of your offspring.\u0022 (Sahih
al Bukhari).\n\n
        <b>Adam\u0027s Progeny Accept Allah</b>\n\n
Allah the Almighty revealed:\n\n
<i>\u0022Remember when your Lord brought forth from the children of Adam, from their loins, their seed
(or from Adam\u0027s loin his offspring) and made them testify as to themselves saying: \u0027Am I not
your Lord?\u0027 They said: \u0027Yes! We testify\u0027 lest you should say on the Day of Resurrectio:. \u0027Verily
we have been unaware of this\u0027. Or lest you should say: \u0027It was only our father aforetime who took
others as partners in worship along with Allah and we were merely their descendants after them;
will you then destroy us because of the deeds of men who practiced al batil (polytheism) and
committing crimes and sins, invoking and worshipping others besides Allah?\u0027\n
Thus do We explain the Ayah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc) in detail
so that they may turn unto the truth\u0022.</i> (Ch 7:172-174 Quran).\n
Adam\u0027s progeny declared: \u0022Our Lord, we bear witness that You are our Lord; we have no other
Lord but Allah. Allah raised their father Adam, and he looked at them and saw those of them who
were rich and those who were poor, and those who had good forms and those who did not. Adam
said: \u0022O Allah! I wish You to make Your servants equal.\u0022 Allah replied \u0022I love being thanked.\u0022
Adam saw among the prophets like lamps among his progeny.\n\n
        <b>The Prophet\u0027s Covenant</b>\n\n
Almighty Allah declared:\n\n
<i>\u0022Remember when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you (o Muhammad), and
from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a strong covenant.</i> (Ch
33:7 Quran).\n\n
In another verse Allah the Exalted commanded:\n\n
<i>\u0022So set you (O Muhammad) your face towards the religion of pure Islamic Monotheism Hanifan
(worship none but Allah Alone) Allah\u0027s Fitrah (Allah\u0027s Islamic Monotheism), with which He has
created mankind. No change let there be in khalqillah (the Religion of Allah--Islamic
Monotheism), that is the straight religion, but most men know not.\u0022</i> (Ch 30:30 Quran).
Another version of the story relates that Allah took a handful of the dust of the earth and mixed
into it the colors, white, black, yellow and red. That is the reason why men are born different
colors. When Allah mixed the dust with water, it turned into potter\u0027s clay that makes a sound. It
was fermented and had a smell. Iblis passed by, wondering what was going to be made of that
clay. From the clay Allah created Adam. he molded his form with His own hands and blew His
spirit into him. Adam\u0027s body quivered as life was imbued into it.\n\n
        <i>\u0022Then We drowned the other (disbelievers and polytheists, etc.).\u0022</i> (Ch 37:82 Quran).\n\n
<b>Similarity between Adam and Jesus (PBUT)</b>\n\n
Allah the Almighty declared:\n\n
        <i>\u0022Verily the likeness of Jesus, in Allah\u0027s Sight is the likeness of Adam, He created him from the
dust then He said to him \u0022Be!\u0022</i> --and he was. (Ch 3:59 Quran).\n\n
        <b>The Meaning of the Angel\u0027s Prostration</b>\n\n
Adam opened his eyes and saw all the angels prostrating before him except one being who was
standing at a distance Adam did not know what kind of creature it was that did not prostrate
before him nor did he know its name. Iblis was standing with the angels so as to be included in the
command given to them but he was not one of them. He was a jinn, and as such he was supposed
to be inferior to the angels. What is clear is that this prostration was to show respect and did not
mean that the angels were worshipping Adam. Prostrating in worship is done only for Allah..
Almighty Allah recounted the story of Iblis\u0027s refusal to prostate before Adam:\n\n
        <i>\u0022Remember when your Lord said to the angels, \u0027I am going to create a man (Adam) from
sounding clay of altered black smooth mud. So when I have fashioned him completely and
breathed into him (Adam) the soul which I created for him then fall you down prostrating
yourselves unto him\u0027. So the angels prostrated themselves all of them together, except Iblis, he
refused to be among the prostrators. Allah said: \u0027O Iblis! What is your reason for not being
among the prostrators?\u0027 Iblis said: \u0027I am not the one to prostrate myself to a human being, whom
You created from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud.\u0027 Allah said: \u0027Then get out from
here for verily you are Rajim (an outcast or cursed one). Verily the curse shall be upon you till
Day of Recompense (Day of Resurrection)\u0027\u0022.</i> (Ch 15:28-35 Quran).\n\n
In another surah Almighty Allah recounted it thus:\n\n
        <i>\u0022Surely We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a
human being), then We told the angels: \u0027Prostrate to Adam and they prostrated except Iblis he
refused to be of those who prostrate\u0022.\n
Allah said: \u0022What prevented you Iblis that you did not prostrate when I commanded you?\u0022 Iblis
said: \u0027I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire and him You created from clay.\u0027
Allah said: \u0027Get down from this Paradise, it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you
are of those humiliated and disgraced.\u0027 Iblis said: \u0027Allow me respite till the Day of
Resurrection).\u0027 Allah said: \u0027You are of those allowed respite.\u0027\u0022</i> (Ch 7:11-15 Quran).\n
Ibn Jarir reported that Muhammad Ibn sirin said that the first one to reach a conclusion by
reasoning was Iblis and that the sun and moon were not worshiped except through this method.
This means that Iblis tried to compare himself to Adam. He believed that he was more honorable
than Adam. Therefore he abstained from prostrating even though Allah had commanded him to do
so, just as He had commanded the angels.\n\n
If an analogy is made we see that Iblis is vain. For indeed clay is better than fire because in it can
be found the qualities of calmness, clemency, perseverance and growth; whereas in fire can be
found heedlessness, insignificance, haste, and incineration.
Iblis tried in vain to justify his refusal:\n\n
